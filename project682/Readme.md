## The Problem statement
Test the existing code of RSA0248 Encryption/Decryption in micropython using raspberry-pi pico-w

## Solution
Tested all the code snippets of the existing code using the unittest library of micropython.

## Testing
The main aim of testing is to identify and remove errors. Testing helps the developers and testers to compare actual and expected results in order to improve quality. This project focuses on unit testing to test the code base for its functionality. Unit tests focus on testing individual parts of the code for its correctness. We have used the UnitTest library from micropython to work on the testing.

## Use cases
* used for transmission of sensitive data over an insecued network, ensuring that only the intended recipient can access the information.
* used for digital signatures to verify the authenticity of the data sender.
